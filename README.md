Shodan, Zoomeye, Censys API

- Shodan (Sentient Hyper-Optimised Data Access Network www.shodan.io) is a search engine designed to map and gather information about internet-connected devices and systems. 
Shodan is sometimes referred to as a search engine for the internet of things (IoT).
- Censys.io (www.censys.io) is a web-based search platform for assessing attack surface for Internet connected devices. 
The tool can be used not only to identify Internet connected assets and Internet of Things/Industrial Internet of Things (IoT/IIoT), but Internet-connected industrial control systems and platforms.
- ZoomEye(www.zoomeye.org) is a search engine for cyberspace. Through the analysis of the global nodes by the distributed crawler engine of the back end, the characteristics of each node are discriminated,
thereby obtaining information such as devices, websites and services or components used in the Internet space. Security researchers can use ZoomEye to learn about component penetration rate and the scope of the vulnerability impact.
ZoomEye uses Xmap and Wmap at its core for grabbing data from publicly exposed devices and web services and doing fingerprint analysis
